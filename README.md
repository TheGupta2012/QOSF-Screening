# QOSF-Screening 
:large_orange_diamond: This repository contains the solution for the screening tasks of QOSF cohort1 - 2021

- The task chosen was **Task 2 - Correction of Quantum Errors**
- [This](https://github.com/TheGupta2012/QOSF-Screening/blob/master/Screening%20Task2%20-%20Detecting%20Errors.ipynb) notebook contains the observations, code and solution for the same. Just in case it does not open, please click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TheGupta2012/QOSF-Screening/blob/master/Screening%20Task2%20-%20Detecting%20Errors.ipynb)
- If rendering error persists, please download the [pdf](https://github.com/TheGupta2012/QOSF-Screening/blob/master/Screening%20Task2%20-%20Detecting%20Errors.pdf) from the link.
- Primary library used for the implementation of tasks was **qiskit** by *IBM*
- All the Sub Tasks have been implemented as separate headings in the notebook and should be easily accessible. Any kind of observations or assumptions made are attached to the notebook itself. :smiley:
